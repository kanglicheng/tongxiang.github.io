I'm a mobile software engineer at [DoSomething.org](https://www.dosomething.org/), one of the largest organizations for young people and social change. I currently spend most of my time building native experiences with iOS, but also work with Node.js to build software which powers our SMS engagement experiences--we also use texting as the medium for 'choose-your-own-adventure' -style games. (Text 'bully' to 38383 to play [The Bully Text](https://www.dosomething.org/campaigns/bully-text-superstar-edition), a game where you decide how to stand up to bullies!) 

I'm fascinated by the intersection of tech and the public sector, and formerly built software for [Venture for America](http://ventureforamerica.org/) and taught curious people how to program at [Fullstack Academy](http://www.fullstackacademy.com/). Duke 2013, BA in English.
