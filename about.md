I'm a programmer at [DoSomething.org](https://www.dosomething.org/), one of the largest organizations for young people and social change. I work primarily with Node.js to build software which powers our SMS engagement experiences--not only do we text our members with information about campaigns, we also use texting as the medium for 'choose-your-own-adventure' -style games. (Text 'bully' to 38383 to play [The Bully Text](https://www.dosomething.org/campaigns/bully-text-superstar-edition), a game where you decide how to stand up to bullies!) 

I'm broadly interested in tech <> the public sector, and formerly built software for [Venture for America](http://ventureforamerica.org/) and served as a teaching fellow at [Fullstack Academy](http://www.fullstackacademy.com/). Duke 2013, BA in English.
