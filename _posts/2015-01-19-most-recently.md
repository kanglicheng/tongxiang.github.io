When was the last time you scraped your knee?  
Or picked a spot, yelling, and raced someone there?  
Opened your palms, coming clean?  
Sat on the shoulders of someone else to see something neither of you could see standing?  

When was the last time you lay down, baffled and exhausted?  
Learned something and then immediately heard it in use?  
Lapped it all up, cat-like?  
Paid attention to all the traces you left behind, as carefully as in the wilderness?
