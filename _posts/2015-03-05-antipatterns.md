###why did it take me so long to debug my code?

While working through a bug or trying to understand a foreign piece of code, I sometimes catch myself zoning out. I'd be mindlessly looking through code trying things arbitrarily--a few lines commented out here, a new function there.

Sooner or later, an hour's gone by without much progress. What caused this mindlessness? 

###what causes coding like a zombie

1. **Beginning the day in a bad mood.** It's easy to keep thinking about what's bothering you, rather than the task at hand. 

2. **Inaccurate evaluations of how long something will take.** My thought process: “Oh, understanding how this works completely, or looking through the source code, will take too much time. Instead, I’m going to try guesses or hunches. If I luck out, I’ll save time.” Sometimes guesses do save time. In the long run, though, a debugging strategy based on guesses costs you. 

3. **Overconfidence.** Generally, overestimating my own abilities to understand foreign code by quickly glancing through it. 

4. **Laziness.** Or maybe more accurately, lacking energy and focus. It's particularly easy to get mindless after a heavy lunch, or at the end of an afternoon. 

###how to avoid coding like a zombie

1. **Meditating before beginning a workday.** I've found that this, especially, helps prevent waking up in a bad mood from stealing my focus for the day. 

2. **Keeping project and bug logs.** When beginning a project, I break tasks down and put them in order. When debugging, I also write down the strategies I'm trying and take notes of what has failed and why. These help me to stay focused. 

3. **Stepping through code early and often.** When encountering something I don't understand, I use a debugger as soon as possible. While stepping through code may take more time to find an error in the short term, inevitably it saves time over the long run of bugs as I'm able to more thoroughly understand a codebase. 

4. **Reading the source code.** Similarly, if I'm using a library, I've started checking out the source code as soon as possible in the debugging process. 

5. **Snacks!** Trail mix, fruit, and water.
