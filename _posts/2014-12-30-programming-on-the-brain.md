title: how programming has fundamentally rewired my brain
---

How have I changed in the year since I've begun learning to code? Becoming a programmer has: 

###1. shown me the intrinsic joy that building things gives you. 
Remember what playing with Legos felt like? For a lot of people, programming tickles the same parts of your brain. 

###2. allowed me to perceive the (fairly expansive) possibilities of a career based in creating things.
(Entrepreneurship in a broad definition: creating your own products from scratch.) I can now think about a software-based idea or business model, and begin to understand how someone might go about building a prototype. (emphasis on **begin** to understand.) 

###3. changed my intellectual habits to become more productivity-oriented, process-driven, and dedicated to continual improvement.
I now, somewhat absurdly, think about best practices *all the time*, whether the thing is programming, health and wellness, or being a good partner or friend. (For example, I now think about [sensible defaults](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) when it comes to feeding myself. Every workday, I pack the same 64-ounce OXO container with the same salad. (I get a lot of crap in the office for this--I'm a tasteless automaton who will eat salads of horrific combinations like blueberries and tahini.)

###4. given me the confidence that I can learn and master difficult things. 
A friend of mine told me that in learning to program, she's become an "alpha learner" in other fields--dancing, drawing, conducting research. I'm not sure if I'm quite there yet, but I'd say that one of the most wonderful unacknowledged benefits of learning to code is how **your threshold of dealing with the huge discomfort of learning new things increases pretty dramatically**.

This is the coding-precipitated change in myself I value the most. Studying English as an undergrad, I didn't seriously consider the process of acquiring entirely new forms of knowledge. (Okay, sure, critical theory blew my mind. But while the domains of theory and literature changed, the forms of knowledge remained the same.) To be a programmer, on the other hand, is to take a fundamentally non-conservative approach to knowledge--the tools will always change, the hardware will always get better and more variegated in functionality (the internet of things, anyone?)--and keep learning, always.

It was probably this impulse which led me to take a super-introductory hip hop dance class, which culminated in a performance last weekend. Classes--incredibly uncomfortable at the onset--produced less and less discomfort, and then finally, we mastered our basic routine, and danced our little hearts out. Yeah, it was mad silly. But super satisfying.
